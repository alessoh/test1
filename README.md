 Introduction
The next generation AI foundation models will achieve reasoning and logic abilities equivalent to PhD level. And while AI doctors, AI lawyers, and AI engineers are not ready to hang out their shingles, every doctor, lawyer, and engineer will want a specialized AI partner to assist them in delivering premium service to their clients.â€‹

# The Problem
AI agent teams partnering with professionals face poor coordination, limited adaptability, and inconsistent performance. Trust issues and integration hurdles hinder adoption. AI needs better collaboration mechanisms, adaptive learning, and robust feedback loops to improve. Enhancing communication skills and ethical decision-making is crucial. The goal is to create transparent, flexible AI agent teams that learn continuously, providing reliable assistance across various professional fields.

# The Solution
We are developing an AI Agent Team Architecture called Syzygi (pronounced SIZ-in-jee) that mimics some features of the neural net Transformer Architecture used to train LLMs. Syzygi architecture provides power and flexibility for AI agents to synchronize their tasks on one project and train as a team over many projects. As they perform more varied tasks, they become more versatile and efficient as an organization - they learn to become a better team.

# # Syzygi - AI Agent Team Architecture
In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, we are witnessing a convergence of multi-agent systems and transformer-based language models. Syzygi presents a novel architecture that synergizes the strengths of specialized AI agents with the powerful mechanisms found in transformer models. It is centered around a large language model (LLM) acting as a neural transformer. This approach aims to enhance collaborative problem-solving, adaptability, and scalability in AI systems.

# Why use CrewAI as base?
The power of AI collaboration has too much to offer. CrewAI is designed to enable AI agents to assume roles, share goals, and operate in a cohesive unit - much like a well-oiled crew. Whether you're building a smart assistant platform, an automated customer service ensemble, or a multi-agent research team, CrewAI provides the backbone for sophisticated multi-agent interactions.

# Getting Started
To get started follow these simple steps:

# 1. Installation
pip install crewai
If you want to install the 'crewai' package along with its optional features that include additional tools for agents, you can do so by using the following command: pip install 'crewai[tools]'. This command installs the basic package and also adds extra components which require more dependencies to function."

pip install 'crewai[tools]' 

# 2. Setting Up Your Crew
add app.py

UI Streamlit
pip install streamlit 
add file streamlit_app.py

streamlit run streamlit_app.py
# Key Features
Role-Based Agent Design: Customize agents with specific roles, goals, and tools.
Autonomous Inter-Agent Delegation: Agents can autonomously delegate tasks and inquire amongst themselves, enhancing problem-solving efficiency.
Flexible Task Management: Define tasks with customizable tools and assign them to agents dynamically.
Processes Driven: Currently only supports sequential task execution and hierarchical processes, but more complex processes like consensual and autonomous are being worked on.
Save output as file: Save the output of individual tasks as a file, so you can use it later.
Parse output as Pydantic or Json: Parse the output of individual tasks as a Pydantic model or as a Json if you want to.
Works with Open Source Models: Run your crew using Open AI or open source models refer to the Connect crewAI to LLMs page for details on configuring your agents' connections to models, even ones running locally!
Examples
You can test different real life examples of AI crews in the crewAI-examples repo:

How CrewAI Compares
Autogen: While Autogen does good in creating conversational agents capable of working together, it lacks an inherent concept of process. In Autogen, orchestrating agents' interactions requires additional programming, which can become complex and cumbersome as the scale of tasks grows.

ChatDev: ChatDev introduced the idea of processes into the realm of AI agents, but its implementation is quite rigid. Customizations in ChatDev are limited and not geared towards production environments, which can hinder scalability and flexibility in real-world applications.

CrewAI's Advantage: CrewAI is built with production in mind. It offers the flexibility of Autogen's conversational agents and the structured process approach of ChatDev, but without the rigidity. CrewAI's processes are designed to be dynamic and adaptable, fitting seamlessly into both development and production workflows.
